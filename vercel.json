#### **FILE 2: Check for `index.html`**

**Do you have a file called `index.html` in your repo?**

- If **YES** → Skip to Step 3
- If **NO** → We need to rename your main HTML file to `index.html`

**To rename:**
1. Click on your main HTML file (the homepage one)
2. Click the pencil icon (edit)
3. Change filename to `index.html`
4. Commit changes
